    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package skinless, boneless chicken breasts (such as PerdueÂ®)</li>
        <li>4 slices mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray. Place chicken on
            the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, add
            desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 12
            more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74
            degrees C).</li>

    </ol>
